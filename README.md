# Ad Campaign Performance Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Ad Campaign Performance Analysis project I completed during my Data Analyst internship at Excelerate. The project involved analyzing marketing data to identify underperforming ad campaigns and provide recommendations for discontinuation.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To analyze ad campaign data and make data-driven recommendations for campaign optimization.

- **Tools Used**: SQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy), Excel, Power BI.

- **Data Source**: The dataset used for analysis is available in the "Data" folder.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis. You can find it in the "ad_campaign_data.csv" file.

- **Analysis**: The Jupyter Notebook "Ad_Campaign_Analysis.ipynb" in this folder contains the code used for data analysis and visualization.

- **Reports**: This folder includes the final report "Campaign_Analysis_Report.pdf" and presentation slides "Presentation_Slides.pptx."

- **Results**: Visualizations and charts generated during the analysis are available here.

- **Documentation**: Additional project documentation, such as a data dictionary or notes, can be found here.

## How to Use

To reproduce the analysis and visualize the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in "requirements.txt."
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook "Ad_Campaign_Analysis.ipynb."
